## Matrice Practice
Create a matrice and mess with it! 
```{r}
# make a sequence of values from 1 to 10
my_values <- seq(from = 1, to = 10,by =1)
# always double check by printing or running variable for output 
my_values

# convert to matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = F)

my_matrix

matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = T) # warning because dimensions do not provide enough slots for 10 numbers


```
